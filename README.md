# initial-project
This is the repo where we are exploring a lot of different options to find a surrogate model to simulate airfoils under different aerodynamic conditions. This project is a joint development with Davut Karataş, Kaan Öktem, and Ege Artan co-leading. It is also being developed in collaboration with UTMIST Research Department at University of Toronto and MAIC at University of Manchester.

We are initially intending to do extensive research on how we can conduct this surrogate modelling, the project will evolve in later stages.
