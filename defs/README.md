- Inside models:
    - NIF:
        - NIF_Pointwise: A modification on the original NIF where we pointwise multiply the latent space instead of defining layers with it
        - NIF_PartialPaper: We define only some layers with the latent space
        - NIF_Paper: We fully define all ShapeNet layers with the latent space
        - NIF_PaperSiren: The full application of the NIF model shown in the paper, with SIREN layers
        - NIF_PaperFourier: Where the ParamNet is replaced with an FNO
    - MLP: A file where we define:
        - DNN: A regular deep neural net
    - Literature:
        - NIF_TF: Direct application of the Paper NIF with TensorFlow

- Inside helper_functions:
    - data_manipulation_functions: Various different functions to manipulate the input data into tensors
    - training_functions: Various training functions
    - create_model_and_optimizer_functions: Various model and optimizer initialization functions
